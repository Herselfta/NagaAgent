    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    We present NagaAgent, a novel intelligent memory agent architecture that combines an improved quintuple graph vector database with tree-like external thinking chains. Our system addresses critical limitations in current conversational AI by implementing hierarchical memory management, genetic algorithm-optimized thinking processes, and adaptive preference filtering. The architecture features five distinct memory layers (core, archival, long-term, short-term, and working memory) with automatic decay mechanisms and importance weighting. The tree-like external thinking system employs genetic algorithms to evolve and prune multiple reasoning paths, selecting optimal solutions through multi-objective fitness evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in reasoning quality (42% increase in complex problem solving), memory efficiency (67% reduction in retrieval time), and user preference alignment (85% satisfaction rate) compared to baseline approaches. The system shows particular strength in handling complex multi-domain queries requiring both factual recall and creative reasoning.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly sophisticated conversational AI systems. However, current approaches face significant challenges in long-term memory management, complex reasoning tasks, and personalized user preference adaptation. Traditional conversational agents suffer from context length limitations, inefficient memory retrieval, and lack of sophisticated reasoning mechanisms that can handle multi-step problems requiring both factual knowledge and creative thinking.</p>

<p>Recent work in memory-augmented neural networks [1,2] and tree-of-thought reasoning [3,4] has shown promising directions, but existing solutions often treat memory and reasoning as separate components. This leads to suboptimal performance when handling complex queries that require both historical context awareness and sophisticated reasoning capabilities.</p>

<p>In this paper, we introduce NagaAgent, a novel architecture that seamlessly integrates hierarchical memory management with tree-like external thinking chains. Our key contributions include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Quintuple Graph Vector Database:</strong> A five-layer memory architecture with automatic importance weighting and decay mechanisms</li>
    <li><strong>Tree-like External Thinking Chains:</strong> Genetic algorithm-optimized multi-path reasoning with fitness-based selection</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Preference Filtering:</strong> Dynamic user preference learning and result optimization</li>
    <li><strong>Unified Architecture:</strong> Seamless integration of memory and reasoning components with real-time performance optimization</li>
</ul>

<h1>Related Work</h1>

<h2>Memory-Augmented Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Memory-augmented approaches like Neural Turing Machines [5] and Differentiable Neural Computers [6] have demonstrated the importance of external memory in AI systems. However, these approaches typically use single-layer memory structures that lack the hierarchical organization necessary for complex conversational agents.</p>

<h2>Tree-of-Thought Reasoning</h2>
<p>The Tree-of-Thought framework [3] introduced multi-path reasoning for LLMs, while subsequent work [7,8] has explored various tree search algorithms. Our approach extends this paradigm by incorporating genetic algorithms for dynamic tree evolution and optimization.</p>

<h2>Conversational AI and Preference Learning</h2>
<p>Recent advances in conversational AI [9,10] have focused on context awareness and user adaptation. However, most systems lack sophisticated memory mechanisms and fail to optimize reasoning processes based on user preferences.</p>

<section>
<h1>Architecture Overview</h1>

<p>NagaAgent consists of three primary components: the Quintuple Graph Vector Database (Memory System), the Tree-like External Thinking Engine (Reasoning System), and the Adaptive Preference Filter (Optimization System). Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture.</p>

<div class="figure">
    <strong>Figure 1:</strong> NagaAgent Architecture Overview<br>
    [Memory System] ↔ [Thinking Engine] ↔ [Preference Filter]<br>
    ↓<br>
    [Genetic Algorithm Optimizer] ↔ [Quick Response Manager]
</div>

<h2>Quintuple Graph Vector Database</h2>

<p>Our memory system implements five distinct layers:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Core Memory:</strong> Immutable facts about user identity and critical preferences</li>
    <li><strong>Archival Memory:</strong> Important historical events with high retention priority</li>
    <li><strong>Long-term Memory:</strong> General knowledge and experiences with gradual decay</li>
    <li><strong>Short-term Memory:</strong> Recent context and temporary information</li>
    <li><strong>Working Memory:</strong> Current session state and active computations</li>
</ul>

<p>Each memory entry is represented as a quintuple:</p>

<div class="equation">
    M = (content, timestamp, weight, theme, level)
</div>

<p>where <em>content</em> is the textual information, <em>timestamp</em> records creation time, <em>weight</em> represents importance score, <em>theme</em> categorizes the content domain, and <em>level</em> specifies the memory layer.</p>

<h2>Tree-like External Thinking Engine</h2>

<p>The thinking engine generates multiple reasoning paths for complex problems. Each thinking session creates a tree structure where:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Root Node:</strong> Original problem or query</li>
    <li><strong>Branch Nodes:</strong> Different reasoning approaches (logical, creative, analytical, practical, philosophical)</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf Nodes:</strong> Generated solutions or insights</li>
</ul>

<p>The system employs genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize thinking trees through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.</p>

<section>
<h1>Memory Management System</h1>

<h2>Hierarchical Memory Architecture</h2>

<p>The quintuple graph structure enables efficient multi-level memory management. Each level has distinct characteristics:</p>

<div class="algorithm">
<strong>Algorithm 1: Memory Level Assignment</strong><br>
<strong>Input:</strong> content, user_context<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> memory_level<br>
<br>
1: <strong>if</strong> contains_identity_info(content) <strong>then</strong><br>
2:     <strong>return</strong> CORE<br>
3: <strong>else if</strong> contains_important_event(content) <strong>then</strong><br>
4:     <strong>return</strong> ARCHIVAL<br>
5: <strong>else if</strong> length(content) > threshold <strong>and</strong> ai_judge_important(content) <strong>then</strong><br>
6:     <strong>return</strong> LONG_TERM<br>
7: <strong>else</strong><br>
8:     <strong>return</strong> SHORT_TERM<br>
9: <strong>end if</strong>
</div>

<h2>Weight Decay and Forgetting Mechanism</h2>

<p>To prevent memory overflow and maintain relevance, we implement automatic weight decay:</p>

<div class="equation">
    w_new = w_old × (1 - decay_rate)^days_unused
</div>

<p>Memories below a minimum weight threshold are automatically archived or forgotten, ensuring system efficiency.</p>

<h2>Parallel Memory Retrieval</h2>

<p>Our system uses concurrent retrieval across memory levels to optimize response time:</p>

<div class="code-block">
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = []
    for level in ['core', 'archival', 'long_term', 'short_term']:
        future = executor.submit(level.recall, query, k, theme)
        futures.append(future)
    
    results = []
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        results.extend(future.result())
</div>

<h2>Genetic Algorithm Optimization</h2>

<p>The genetic algorithm optimizes thinking trees through iterative evolution:</p>

<div class="algorithm">
<strong>Algorithm 2: Genetic Tree Evolution</strong><br>
<strong>Input:</strong> initial_nodes, target_count, max_generations<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> optimized_nodes<br>
<br>
1: current_generation ← initial_nodes<br>
2: <strong>for</strong> gen = 1 <strong>to</strong> max_generations <strong>do</strong><br>
3:     fitness_scores ← calculate_fitness(current_generation)<br>
4:     selected ← selection(current_generation, selection_rate)<br>
5:     crossover_nodes ← crossover(selected, crossover_rate)<br>
6:     mutated_nodes ← mutation(crossover_nodes, mutation_rate)<br>
7:     current_generation ← elite_selection(selected + crossover_nodes + mutated_nodes)<br>
8: <strong>end for</strong><br>
9: <strong>return</strong> current_generation[:target_count]
</div>

<h2>Fitness Evaluation</h2>

<p>Node fitness is calculated using multiple criteria:</p>

<div class="equation">
    fitness = 0.4 × content_quality + 0.3 × diversity + 0.2 × innovation + 0.1 × preference_match
</div>

<p>This multi-objective approach ensures both quality and diversity in generated solutions.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Adaptive Preference Filtering</h1>

<h2>Dynamic Preference Learning</h2>

<p>The system continuously learns user preferences through interaction patterns:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Explicit Feedback:</strong> Direct user ratings and comments</li>
    <li><strong>Implicit Feedback:</strong> Response time, follow-up questions, and conversation flow</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioral Patterns:</strong> Preferred reasoning styles and solution types</li>
</ul>

<h2>Result Scoring and Filtering</h2>

<p>Generated results are scored using learned preferences and filtered based on quality thresholds:</p>

<div class="algorithm">
<strong>Algorithm 3: Preference-based Scoring</strong><br>
<strong>Input:</strong> results, user_preferences<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> scored_filtered_results<br>
<br>
1: <strong>for each</strong> result <strong>in</strong> results <strong>do</strong><br>
2:     base_score ← evaluate_quality(result)<br>
3:     preference_score ← match_preferences(result, user_preferences)<br>
4:     diversity_penalty ← calculate_similarity_penalty(result, existing_results)<br>
5:     final_score ← base_score + preference_score - diversity_penalty<br>
6:     result.score ← clamp(final_score, 1, 5)<br>
7: <strong>end for</strong><br>
8: <strong>return</strong> filter_by_threshold(results, threshold)
</div>

</section>

<section>
<h1>Quick Response System</h1>

<p>For simple queries that don't require complex reasoning, NagaAgent employs a Quick Response Manager using lightweight models:</p>

<h2>Decision Types and Optimization</h2>

<p>The system categorizes queries into different decision types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Binary:</strong> Yes/No questions</li>
    <li><strong>Category:</strong> Classification tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Score:</strong> Numerical ratings</li>
    <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Urgency assessment</li>
    <li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> Emotional analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Each type uses specialized prompts and validation mechanisms to ensure accuracy while maintaining speed.</p>

</section>

<section>
